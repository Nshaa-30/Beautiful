        Beautiful, I have a message for you which I feel from my heart:<br><br>
        You’ve walked the tough road with strength, patience, and passion.<br><br>
        You chose a life of service — and that’s something truly admirable.<br><br>
        Your journey from books to scrubs is inspiring, and the best is yet to come.<br><br>
        The world needs more doctors like you — kind, committed, and full of heart.<br><br>
        May every life you touch be healed not just by your hands, but also by your compassion.<br><br>
        I’m proud to know you, and even prouder to call you a friend. Here’s to your dedication, your dreams, and the lives you’ll continue to change.<br><br>
        Keep shining, Dr. Deekshitha — the world is better because of you.<br><br>
        I wish you to complete your Graduation soon and look at us and want you to get a good college in PG and wish you make all of us proud.<br><br>
        Wish you all the best for your exams, hope you will be getting the best result you deserve...🫶🏻❤<br><br>
        All the best for pre-finals — no worries even if it doesn't go well.<br>
        Let's see in final exams 🙌🏻<br><br>
